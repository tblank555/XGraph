_A 3D graphics engine by T Blank_

I made this 3D graphics engine by following the [incredible tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih20l3pJoeU&ab_channel=javidx9) by [OneLoneCoder (Javidx9)](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder) on YouTube.

It utilizes's Javidx9's [PixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) to read keyboard input and draw pixels on the screen, but everything else is done manually!

This was just a fun project for me to learn more about how 3D rendering works.
